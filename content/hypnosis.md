Hello stranger, and welcome to the Fractala.

You have been invited to the Experience.  
As a first step, you must venture through the Hypnosis.  
The Portal will lead you to the unknown, whether you like it or not, whether youâ€™re ready or
not.  
The Self will emerge, and it will either pledge allegiance or oppose.

Enjoy the Journey
